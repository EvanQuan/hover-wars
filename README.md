# CPSC 585 - Games Programming - Winter 2019

## Compilation

### Compiling on Windows:

**Compiled using MSVS 2017.**

1. The Libraries and Settings should all be set up in the VS project.

### Compiling on Linux:

**NOT TESTED**
1. In the file EnvSpec.h: You'll need to switch the comment from Defining
   Windows to Defining Linux.

2. The included Makefile should generate a run file that will launch the
   program.

**Right Click** - Holding down Right Click and moving the mouse will allow you to adjust the camera around the vehicle

#### Debug Commands (for Debug mode only)

##### Switching Keyboard Player

**1** - Player 1

**2** - Player 2

**3** - Player 3

**4** - Player 4

**F** - Toggle Wireframe Mode

**C** - Toggle Debug Camera for current player

**B** - Toggle Bounding Box rendering

**M** - Toggle Spatial Map Debug rendering

**Keypad 0** - Set User Interface display count to 0

**Keypad 1** - Set User Interface display count to 1

**Keypad 2** - Set User Interface display count to 2

**Keypad 3** - Set User Interface display count to 3

**Keypad 4** - Set User Interface display count to 4

**R** - Player 1 hits Player 2

**T** - Player 2 hits Player 1

#### XBOX Controller

Currently, basic driving is implemented. The controls are:

**Left Joystick** - Applies a force on the vehicle in that direction on the xz-plane, WRT to Vehicle space.

**Right Joystick** - Rotates the vehicle left or right.

**RT** - Drops a particle emitter at the vehicle's current location until released.

## Write-Up:

Since Milestone 2:
Font Rendering: The TTF file for the font is parsed using FreeType and saved into an internal bitmap layout of all the valid characters for rendering text. Then each glyph information (uv offset/size, bearing, advance) is stored in a hashmap for indexing into the bitmap. This allows us to render full lines of text with 1 draw call as opposed to having a texture for each glyph and a draw call for each character. 

Spatial Data Map: There's a basic Spatial Data Map in place that is intended to be utilized for pathfinding and other necessities. On scene load, all the entities are given to the spatial data map who populates a static map as well as a hashtable listing the spatial parameters for each entity in the scene. Dynamic Entities are updated as they move while static entities are left untouched within the static data map. While running in debug mode, you can view a visual representation of the spatial data structure by pressing 'm'. This rendering is rather expensive and is only available in debug mode. The color codes are as follows:

    - Red: This represents a Static Entity. Pathfinding will probably treat these spaces as unpassable terrain for finding a path to their target.
    - White: This represents the Space a Point Light covers. I had intended to speed up lighting calculations by only using lights that the entity is near. This is currently not the case, but it may be revisted in the future.
    - Purple: This represents a Spot Light. We had a vision for the aesthetic to be gritty and cyber-punky. We wanted Spotlights to cast shadows as dynamic entities crossed under them. In order to limit shadow calculations, I wanted to have a default shadow map for each light and only calculate shadows for spotlights that have a dynamic entity within their space. This may not make it to release.
    - Jade: This represents a dynamic entity. Dynamic Entities cover multiple spaces based on their spatial dimensions and it's important that they stay updated every frame.

Shadow Mapping: The directional light in the scene casts shadows. The shadow map is specified in the scene that loaded in under the directional light entity entry. The texture size for the shadow is rather large to avoid overly pixellated shadows. Also, a smoothing kernel is applied to the shadows to soften their edges and blend with the fragment colors in a nicer way.

AI: The AI works on a basic follw/seek model. it oscillates between following the player and seeking a random point on the map.
The goal of this AI is to collide with the player with spikes engaged. This will result in the AI gaining a point. Visa versa if the player collides
with the AI the player will gain a point
