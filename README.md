# CPSC 585 - Games Programming - Winter 2019

## Compilation

### Compiling on Windows:

**Compiled using MSVS 2017.**

1. The Libraries and Settings should all be set up in the VS project.

### Compiling on Linux:

**NOT TESTED**
1. In the file EnvSpec.h: You'll need to switch the comment from Defining
   Windows to Defining Linux.

2. The included Makefile should generate a run file that will launch the
   program.

## Write-Up:

Objects in the world now have Materials attached to their meshes. These Materials consists of a diffuse map, a specular map or shade and a shininess value. Full lighting is implemented, including Directional Lighting, Point Lighting and Spot Lighting. The current maximum set to be rendered in the scene is 1 Directional Light, 4 Point Lights and 4 Spot Lights; these will probably increase later on.

When you load up the program, you'll see a textured plane with a white spot light just overhead of the origin. The World Axis is rendered at the origin for reference/testing purposes and 3 point lights are rendered as Axis parameters as well. You'll see quite a few bunnies in the positive xzy quadrant that are testing the static instanced rendering. Holding the right mouse button down and moving the mouse will rotate the camera around the vehicle. If you look higher towards the bunnies, you'll also see a billboard testing object. It renders locked to the up normal vector and facing the camera. It uses the current default texture settings.

The world loads in from the file scene2.scene and can be modified as per the rules stated at the top of that file.


### Sound

Music
- Music transitions and loops

Collision sounds
- Different entities result in different collision sound events.
    - Hovercraft against hovercraft
    - Hovecraft against world
    - Rocket against hovercraft (implemented, but not testable)
    - Flame against hovercraft (implemented, but not testable)
    - Spikes against hovercraft
    - Hovercraft and powerup (not implemented)
- Sound events can randomize between a pool of available sound for that sound event to increase variance. Random sound pools implemented for.
    - Hovercraft against hovercraft
    - Hovercraft against world
    - Spike activation

- Killstreaks
    - Killstreak sound plays when players reaches a high killstreak
    
- Domination/Revenge
    - Domination and revenge sounds play when players dominate another player or get revenge
