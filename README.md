## Write-Up:

When the program is run, a small test environment is loaded up. There is
a textured plane with diffuse lighting, a Car with toon shading, a textured
Sphere with Diffuse lighting and a Cube that's meant to represent the starting
position of the light along with the color of the light. Although the light
moves with the above-mentioned controls, the cube does not move.

This Scene is loaded with the Scene2.txt file using the entity component
framework and loaded with the Scene Loader class as per the Framework
documentation.
