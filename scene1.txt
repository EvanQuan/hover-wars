# Scene file for rendering
#
# Instructions for reading this file:
#   - lines beginning with ‘#’ are comments
#   - all objects are expressed in world coords
#   - objects are described with the following parameters:
#	   - x y z Position for each object
#      - Light Source also has a color associated with it
#      - sphere has centre and radius
#	   - Mesh has a position and string for mesh location
#      - plane has 4 corner positions in clockwise order
#      - triangle has positions of its three corners, in
#        counter-clockwise order
#   - syntax of the object specifications are as follows:
#
#      light    { x  y  z  r  g  b }
#      sphere   { x  y  z  r }
#      plane    { x y z  x1 y1 z1  x2 y2 z3  x3 y3 z3  x4 y4 z4}
#      triangle { x y z  x1 y1 z1  x2 y2 z2  x3 y3 z3 }
#	   mesh		{ x y z  sLocation }
